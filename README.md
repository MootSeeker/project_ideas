| STM32 Sensor Logger    | Optimized Sensor Data Logger | Design an STM32-based data logger that samples temperature, humidity, and pressure sensors every 5 seconds. Store data in flash memory with timestamps, aiming for at least 7 days of continuous logging on a 1MB flash. Implement UART data retrieval at 115200 baud. Target power consumption under 5mA in logging mode, using low-power modes when idle.  | STM32CubeIDE, STM32 HAL/LL drivers, UART, USB, SPI/I2C, Flash memory, Lempel-Ziv compression, FreeRTOS (optional), low-power design. | 4-6 weeks       | 3                 |
